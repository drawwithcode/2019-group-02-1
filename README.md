## **Concept**

**BOBIT** is a gaming project created using p5.js as final project for the Creative Coding course at Politecnico di Milano. The first input was to create a webpage where people could interact with each other in order to reach a common goal. That's how bobit was created! We decided to build an old arcade game, with simple rules that everybody know but with a differece, instead of playing alone, everybody can join the game and collaborate with all the others players to reach the highest score. The aim of the game aren't just the points but also being able to work with the others during an activity that we usually do by ourself.

## **Graphic**

Bobit graphic reminds the old games like brick breaker, bounce and pacman. Everything from the background, the ball, the brick and even the site font ( Press Start 2P ) is designed to reseamble and to bring the player back to a games room in the eighties.
In order to add some difficulties the levels have trippy graphics that distract the player from the ball and the brick which, most of the time, blend in the background. The levels , going two by two, have three different themes that all together create a storytelling, from a domestic habitat in the first and second levels, through the aliens and ufo sigthings and the reach of the Space, to the total abstraction of the final two levels.

## **Interaction**

Bobit is designed to be played on computer only. The player can easily interact with the brick  just using dragging on the touchbar or using the mouse. The idea was to keep it as simple as possible in order to let the player focus on the game only.
